Quick instructions for an installation of a release package:

1. Change to the minicom-$VERSION directory.
2. ./configure (see ./configure --help for options)
3. make
4. make install
5. minicom -s (for changing /etc/minicom you probably need to run it as root)
   Change what should be changed on your system, and choose
   'Save setup as dfl' from the configuration menu to save the
   changed settings as system defaults.
   Now add every user which should be allowed to use minicom to
   the group of the corresponding character devices (e.g. /dev/ttyS0).
   On Debian this group already exists and is called 'dialout'.

Now you should have minicom compiled, installed and ready to use.

For more information, have a look at the other files.

WWW: For information about the newest version, what has changed since the
previous version, and sometimes possibly the newest beta version (if there
is one available), look at https://salsa.debian.org/minicom-team/minicom.

Current development version of minicom can be found here:
https://salsa.debian.org/minicom-team/minicom

To compile and install a development version:
1. git clone https://salsa.debian.org/minicom-team/minicom.git
2. cd minicom
3. ./autogen.sh
4. ./configure (see ./configure --help for options)
5. make
6. make install
