minicom TODO list
-----------------

important:

* update/complete existing translations, see also
  http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/matrix.html
* fix documentation for new -7 switch and the new semantics of
  -l and -L

normal:

* Make "vt_docap = 2" (1:1 capture) accessible to the user.
* Mention (prominently) that running minicom as root is not
  necessary and discouraged.

* sync AUTHORS with man/minicom.1
* merge ChangeLog with */ChangeLog*
* fix Debian BTS bugs
* documentation cleanup
* minicom homepage

* src/dial.c: dhili(): split menu string so that translators can translate
                       it without headaches
* when showing errors also consider showing errno if available/appropriate

* move .minirc* and .macros to .config/minicom/...
  * .macros too

wishlist:

* incorporate outstanding patches from debian/patches
* make minicom.1 an .in file using @sysconfdir@ etc.

* src/rwconf.c: detect paths to [sr][zbx],kermit via configuration

* enhanced protocol between target and minicom
  * compressed transmit
  * transmit speed in statusline
  * multi-channel
  * optionally more status lines

* add remote control interface
  * would allow to inject text/command sequences via minicom-ctrl (or
    similar), e.g. make someimage && minicom-ctrl --xyz thisone "tftpboot ..."

* embed lua
  * eventually replace script language?
  * add filter/trigger/whatever via plugged-in lua scriptlets
